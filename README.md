# Buckshot-Roulette-Terminal
A command line version of Buckshot Roulette in 107 lines of code. MinGW was able to compile it to a 668kb executable.

# How to play
Download the latest release or compile from the source code, then run the application.

Controls are stupid simple. Type "yes"/"y" to shoot yourself, and "no"/"n" to shoot the dealer.

Once the round is over, the game will exit.

# System Requirements
- A keyboard
- Boredom
- An operating system.

TBH if you're compiling it yourself it'll probably run on whatever you compile it for.

# Why?
Short answer: Because I can.

Long answer: I was listening to Delightful KissBoy's technical videos on Buckshot Roulette at work last night (2/16/2026), and I wanted to see if I could replicate the Dealer's AI without looking at the decompiled source code. This was an bold feat to attempt, considering I myself have never played Buckshot Roulette and only recently learned about the game.

At the moment this terminal "port" is obviously insanely bareboned, since there's no items and the terminal just closes once the round is over. I may go back and improve it to make it more feature-complete, but this was literally just a personal test.
